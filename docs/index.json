	"content": " Models are how you tell JollofJS how to structure your data.\nAll models for your app MUST be placed under apps/models\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the User model in there\nconst jollof = require('jollof'); const data = jollof.data; const types = data.types; const jql = data.jql; const schema = { name: 'User', dataSource: 'default', structure: { firstName: String, lastName: String, name: { type: String, meta: { disableEdit: true } }, email: types.Email(), password: { type: String, meta: { widget: 'password' } }, isAdmin: Boolean, accountType: { type: String, meta: { choices: [ 'normal', 'grand', 'epic' ] } } }, ... } module.exports = data.registerModel(schema);  If you have worked with ODMs like Mongoose, this should look familiar.\nStatic Methods To extend this model statically, define schema.statics. ex:\nschema.statics = { async countAllUsersWithFirstName(firstName){ //you have access to all models here via //jollof.models.AnyModel return await jollof.models.User.countBy({firstName}); } }  then you can call those from anywhere using await jollof.models.User.countAllUsers().\nInstance methods To extend a model instance, define schema.methods. ex:\nschema.methods = { async printFullName(){ //Again, you have access to all models here too via //jollof.models.AnyModel return this.firstName + ' '+this.lastName; } }  Notice how this gives you access to the actual instance of the model instance you are extending.\nYou can call a model instance method from a model. i.e\nconst user = jollof.models.User.findOneBy({email: 'foo@bar.com'}) ... //assuming user is not null const fullName = user.printFullName() console.log(fullName)  Native methods It is not Jollof Data\u0026rsquo;s goal to claim to be everything you need to access your data layer. No data abstraction layer can promise that. What it DOES do beautifully well, is get out of the way so you can do access your data yourself. It does so by extending the data adapter for your model through Native methods.\nNative methods are where Jollof Data supercedes all current known data abstraction paradigms.\nschema.native = { mongodb: { async init() { await this.db.collection('User').createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true }); }, } }  In fact, JollofJS actively encourages you to define native functions right from the start because the init() native function is the only place you can define indexes on your model.\nWhen booting, Jollof Data will run the init function for any active native groups. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain:\nIn the startup project, Because the User model uses the 'default' dataSource, which is grouped under the nativeType named 'mongodb' (as seen in config/base.js under datasources), Then that means the nativeType named 'mongodb' is the active nativeType. This means that when the app is started, mongodb.init() will be run automatically by Jollof.  You can define and run other native functions besides init() (eg: generateGraph) and call it via jollof.models.User.native.generateGraph(). Notice how you do not specify the nativeType when calling a native function. JollofJS will figure that out for you depending on what is active.\n"

	"content": " What is JollofJS JollofJS is a futuristic NodeJS web framework and Content management system.\nThe Higlights:\n Built-in Admin User Interface Ever wondered why something like Django Admin doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist for NodeJS? Well with JollofJS, it does now. Administer your site\u0026rsquo;s data with the built-in Jollof Admin (built from scratch using React). E.g You could whip up a blog for your Application and use Jollof Admin as a simple CMS backend for that blog. The options are endless!   Full support for ES8+ features i.e. Async/Await\n Environmental Configuration Tree. JollofJS has a custom-built config system that makes it easy to have different configurations per node.ENV. Base configuration can easily be overwritten by environmental configs (i.e. development, test, production, etc).\n Convention AND configuration. JollofJs starts you off with very good configurations that serve as awesome conventions for your web apps.\n  And more!\n"

The widget used in the admin for this field is a map with a draggable pointer (set long/lat) with place search and address field entry.\nsomeLocation: types.Location()\nCollections A field can also be an array or object of any combination of other fields. ex:\nA string array: tags: [String] or tags: [{type: String}] An array of file fields: files: [ types.File() ] An array of locations: geoBreadCrumb: [types.Location()]\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an object with a string and a location\ngeoMessage: { text: String, location: types.Location() }  And of-course, you can make an array out of that too!\ngeoMessages: [{ text: String, location: types.Location() }]  The possibilities are endless. Enjoy what it feels like to have Total schema freedom and an admin UI that intelligently keep up with your imagination/structure.\n"
