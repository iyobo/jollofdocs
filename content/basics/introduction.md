## What is JollofJS

JollofJS is a futuristic NodeJS web framework and Content management system.



**The Higlights:**

* **Built-in Admin User Interface**
Ever wondered why something like Django Admin doesn't exist for NodeJS? Well with JollofJS, it does now. Administer your site's data with the built-in Jollof Admin (built from scratch using React). E.g You could whip up a blog for your Application and use Jollof Admin as a simple CMS backend for that blog. The options are endless!

* **Full support for ES8+ features**
i.e. Async/Await

* **Environmental Configuration Tree**.
JollofJS has a custom-built config system that makes it easy to have different configurations per node.ENV. Base configuration can easily be overwritten by environmental configs (i.e. development, test, production, etc).

* **Convention AND configuration**.
JollofJs starts you off with very good configurations that serve as awesome conventions for your web apps.

And more!
